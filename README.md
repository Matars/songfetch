# songfetch
A simple CLI tool, very similar to neofetch, that displays current song information in the terminal.

## Player Compatibility

### Works Out of the Box âœ“

Most players **should** work without any additional setup:
- Spotify, VLC, Firefox, Chrome
- Rhythmbox, Clementine, Strawberry, Audacious
- Any player that supports MPRIS2

### Requires Additional Setup

Some terminal/daemon-based players need an MPRIS bridge installed:

| Player | Package to Install | Command |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| **MPD** | `mpdris2` | `yay -S mpdris2` (Arch)<br>`sudo apt install mpdris2` (Debian/Ubuntu)<br>`sudo dnf install mpdris2` (Fedora)<br>`yay -S mpdris2` (Arch) |
| **cmus** | `cmus-mpris` | Check your distro's package manager |
| **moc** | `moc-mpris` | Check your distro's package manager |

After installing the bridge, enable it:
```bash
systemctl --user enable --now mpDris2  # for MPD
enable similar services for other players
```
